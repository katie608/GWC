	  <h1>Sleep Deprivation in Teenagers</h1>
      <p> Sleep is very important and lack of sleep can have numerous detrimental effects on the mind and body. Sleep is very important, especially for teenagers whose minds and bodies are developing, yet teenagers are one of the most sleep-deprived sections of the population. The National Institutes of Health estimate that teenagers need about 9 hours of sleep a night, but only 9% of high school students sleep that much, and 20% of students sleep less than 5 hours a night. Sleep is very important and lack of sleep can have numerous detrimental effects on the mind and body.

	  <h1 id="Consequences">Concequences</h1>
      <p>There are many concequences to sleep deprivation, especially in teenagers. One of the most important is decreased mental ability. This is bad because it leads teenagers to preform lower in school. Other concequences include increased chance of mental illnesses such as depression, and suicide attempts. Sleep deprivation can also lead to an unhealthy weight and eating habits as the lack of sleep inhibits the parts of the brain that control hunger. In general, sleep deprivation is very harmful, so why is it so so common?

      <p>Teenagers circandian rhythms, the body's "clock" that regulates when people get tired, are different from adults'. For teenagers, getting up at 7 am feels like an adult getting up a 5 am. We have known that teenagers are on a different schedule than adults, but our schools still start very early. Some schools have taken this advice, and have begun to start school later. These schools have experienced sucess because their students are more alert and have heightened congnitive ability.
